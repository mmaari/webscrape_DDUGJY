Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) is designed to provide continuous power supply to the entire rural India. The scheme was launched under leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in November 2014 announcing that "the government had decided to electrify 18,452 unelectrified villages within 1000 days, by May 1, 2018. It is one of the key initiatives of Government of India and a flagship programmes of the Ministry of Power. The DDUGJY can benefit rural households significantly as electricity is extremely vital for growth and development of the country [National Portal of India](https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/deen-dayal-upadhyaya-gram-jyoti-yojana).
